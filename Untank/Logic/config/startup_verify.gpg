// This file is used to determine if DS has the right set of tanks on startup.
// People who "accidentally" delete one or more of the tanks in their resource
// folder cause the game to crash and GPG engineers to scratch their heads at
// the resulting report. So starting with 1.1 this file is queried and DS makes
// sure that each of the following files or directories exists before letting
// the game continue to start up. The logic tank is implicit because this file
// is within it, but the others are...

// NOTE: If you're doing a total conversion, make sure to include this file in
// one of your resource tanks, and replace the below config block with files or
// dirs appropriate for your specific tanks.
